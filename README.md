## Project Description
The Coyote Carpool app will enable CSUSB students to schedule carpooling appointments with each other by matching riders and drivers based on the studentsâ€™ locations and respective class schedules. An in-app messaging feature will also allow students to communicate prior to their appointment. 
The main element of this React Native Android application is to match CSUSB students who would like to carpool.
